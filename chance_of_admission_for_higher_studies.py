#Chance of Admission for Higher Studies
 Predict the chances of admission of a student to a Graduate program based on:
 1.GRE Scores (290 to 340)
 2.TOEFL Scores (92 to 120)
 3.University Rating (1 to 5)
 4.Statement of Purpose (1 to 5)
 5.Letter of Recommendation Strength (1 to 5)
 6.Undergraduate CGPA (6.8 to 9.92)
 7.Research Experience (0 or 1)
 8.Chance of Admit (0.34 to 0.9)
